This is the code for the Shiny app that runs at my [website](http://derekhodgson.com/project/flavor-bible-network).

You can modify and run this code yourself easily with RStudio if you want to make any changes. Unfortunately, I won't be uploading the data this app needs to run, as it's from a copywrited work, but this will work with any iGraph file.
