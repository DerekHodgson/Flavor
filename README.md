This is the code for the Shiny app that runs at my [blog](http://quaere-verum.com/?p=123). I'm setting it up so any commits to the master branch will automatically update the EC2 server with the changes using a webhook.

You can modify and run this code yourself easily with RStudio if you want to make any changes. Unfortunately, I won't be uploading the data this app needs to run, as it's from a copywrited work, but this will work with any iGraph file.
